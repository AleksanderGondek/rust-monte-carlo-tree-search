Contains various implementations of Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search

## Background, goals

This repository is being worked upon thanks to [Day\[9\] 30 Day project](https://dk30.day9.tv/projects/247103888958816258-1541921376144).

If you have not heard about the initiative, you should probably check it out, as itâ€™s a really neat way of finding motivation to develop yourself. 

Main goals of the project are as follows:

* Gain experience in Rust programming language 
* Learn Rust helps in solving common issues with concurrent programming
* Explore how Monte-Carlo Tree Search can be applied to solve different games and how to improve its performance
